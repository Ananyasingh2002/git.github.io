## Discussions

### General

* [Git participated in GSoC (Google Summer of Code) 2023](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/organizations/git)

  The following contributors have successfully passed their final
  evaluation and published a final report:

  - Shuqi Liang worked on the
    [More Sparse Index Integrations](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/Rkbc1Abe)
    project. She was mentored by Victoria Dye. The final
    report could be found on [her website](https://cheskaqiqi.github.io/2023/08/22/Final/).

  - Kousik Sanagavarapu worked on the
    [Unify ref-filter formats with other --pretty formats](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/rck3kmq2)
    project. He was co-mentored by Christian Couder and Hariom Verma.

* [Fetching too many tags?](https://lore.kernel.org/git/274ec1a2152b0fd53b35c1591f5177e0b0713430@rjp.ie/)

  Ronan Pigott noticed that when he fetched from some repos, for
  example from the
  ["Linux Stable" repo](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux)
  on [kernel.org](https://git.kernel.org/), most of the time seemed to
  be spent transferring tags from the remote to the client.

  When his local repo was up-to-date and `git fetch` was used with
  `--no-tags` (or its `-n` shortcut), it took less than 0.4 seconds
  versus more than 1.7 seconds without it.

  He asked if there was a reason for this seemingly useless transfer of
  tags even when the remote didn't have to send any commit.

  Peff, alias Jeff King, replied that "this is how the Git protocol
  works". He explained that the server only lists all the refs it
  knows about, and expects the client to select the refs it wants
  among them. "Only the client knows what it already has." For
  example, there could be new tags on the server pointing to commits
  that the client already has.

  Peff also mentioned that in recent Git versions an extension of the
  Git protocol allows clients to list only the refs they are
  interested in, so that the server can send "a much smaller ref
  advertisement".

  Ronan asked if Peff was talking about the `--negotiation-tip`
  option, as some tests using this option didn't result in better
  performance.

  Peff replied that `--negotiation-tip` was only useful when there are
  commits that should be transferred. When histories on the client and
  the server have diverged, this option helps them find a common
  commit that can be the base for the commits that will be
  transferred.

  Peff said the extension of the Git protocol he was talking about are
  "ref-prefix" lines in Git's "v2" protocol, which is the default
  protocol since Git v2.29. This protocol allows the client to speak
  first and specify which ref prefixes it's interested in in these
  "ref-prefix" lines.

  Setting the `GIT_TRACE_PACKET` to `1` allows one to see the packets
  exchanged between the client and the server, especially the
  "ref-prefix" lines when for example `git fetch --no-tags origin
  master` is launched using a recent Git, or the "have" and "want"
  lines when client and server have to negotiate a common commit.

  Ronan tested Peff's suggestions and thanked him as he then
  understood why the tag advertisement was useful.
