* [Git Bug Report: out of memory using `git tag`](https://lore.kernel.org/git/CABYbkvP=fMmaFUD3bQbeQ-XKiMSP6g-u0p7Vq1Qt_K5=D5WJ+A@mail.gmail.com/)

  Martin Englund sent a bug report to the Git mailing list saying that
  after creating a signed tag using a ssh-agent key, he ran the
  following command that should have shown the body part of the tag
  contents:

  `git tag -l --format '%(contents:body)' v0.6.1`

  But instead of displaying anything, the command crashed with:

  `fatal: Out of memory, malloc failed (tried to allocate 18446744073709551266 bytes)`

  Peff, alias Jeff King, thanked Martin for the report and said he had
  found the function where the crash happened and the reason why it
  happened. He also provided minimal reproduction instructions as well
  as the commit that introduced the bug, and he put the author of that
  commit in CC of his email.

  Philippe Blain, the author of the commit, thanked Peff for the
  information and said he would try to find a fix for the bug.

  Peff replied to Philippe that after sleeping on the issue, he fully
  understood what happened. He said there were actually two closely
  related bugs and he was sending 2 patches to fix them both.

  The [first patch](https://lore.kernel.org/git/Y2IfT0UFJ7H%2FmHMz@coredump.intra.peff.net/)
  was a fix for cases where there was no blank line between the
  subject of a tag and the signature in it, and when the signature
  also contained no blank line. Such signatures could be generated by
  ssh.

  In such cases the code wasn't properly detecting the start of the
  signature and was instead using the end of the commit. When
  computing the signature length, this would give a negative value,
  which was then converted to a huge value as the variable for the
  signature length used an unsigned type. In turn when allocating
  memory for the signature, this would lead to the crash as it wasn't
  possible to allocate the requested amount of memory for it.

  The [second patch](https://lore.kernel.org/git/Y2IfwL96Ku%2FdGuJR@coredump.intra.peff.net/)
  fixed a similar bug that occurred when there was a blank line in the
  signature but not before it, and this blank line ended with both the
  CR (Carriage Return) and LF (Line Feed) characters instead of only
  the latter.

  In that case, the start of the signature was also not properly
  detected, so a negative value was assigned to the variable for the
  signature length, which led to a crash when allocating memory for
  the signature.

  Both patches are very well explained in long commit messages. This
  prompted Elijah Newren to reply to Peff joking about the fact that
  Peff's patches didn't set new records for the ratio of commit
  message lines to changed code, as a previous patch from Elijah
  contained 96 lines of explanation to describe a one-line fix.

  In the same spirit, Peff replied to Elijah providing a script to
  find the commit with the highest ratio between lines of explanations
  in the commit message and the lines in the patch. He said that the
  script would show "a few in the 100's".

  Ã†var ArnfjÃ¶rÃ° Bjarmason then replied to Peff contesting the method
  used in Peff's scripts and suggesting computing "the Levenshtein
  distance of the pre- and post-image", and then using that distance
  to commit message length instead of the previous ratio, which would
  find other winners.

  Elijah ended this subthread of discussion about the biggest comment
  to code ratio in a commit in the Git repo with:

  "Hehe, my offhand joke started a contest over the whimsical question of
  who's the most long-winded.  I think my work here is done.  :-)"

  Eric Sunshine, after reviewing Peff's patches, commented that they
  were well explained and that he found no suggestion to improve on
  them.

  Philippe agreed with Eric that the patches were very well explained
  and asked Peff about the case where there would be both no blank
  line and lines terminated with both CR and LF in the tag. Peff then
  confirmed that this would be properly handled by his first patch.

  Taylor Blau, who was handling the maintainer's role in the project
  at that time, as Junio Hamano was having a vacation, also agreed
  that the patches were very well explained, and agreed to take
  them. The patches were then merged and part of the Git v2.39.0
  feature release.

## Developer Spotlight: ZheNing Hu

* Who are you and what do you do?

  My name is ZheNing Hu, and I am a participant in the GSOC 2021
  Git community. Currently I am interning at Alibaba (China).

* What would you name your most important contribution to Git?

  When I used `git shortlog --author="ZheNing Hu"` to look at the patches
  I contributed, I was ashamed to find that my patches are quite small and
  simple, because I'm more of a Git learner right now ðŸ˜„.

  If I had to pick one, I'd say it's adding the `--trailer` option to `git commit`.
  It is very convenient to add something like "Signed-off-by", "Reviewed-by"
  at the end of the commit message.

* What are you doing on the Git project these days, and why?

  Recently I've been working on [implementing a `--scope` option for `git diff`](https://lore.kernel.org/git/pull.1398.v3.git.1669723221.gitgitgadget@gmail.com/)
  and other Git commands. It tries to limit the scope of the file path to the
  [sparse specification](https://github.com/git/git/blob/7c2ef319c52c4997256f5807564523dfd4acdfc7/Documentation/technical/sparse-checkout.txt#L73).

  The reason I wanted to implement this feature is that I was researching
  how monorepo users collaborate and discovered that `git pull` might download
  Git objects outside of the sparse specification. Meanwhile, Elijah Newren
  is contributing the [technical documentation of git-sparse-checkout](https://git-scm.com/docs/sparse-checkout)
  [ [source](https://github.com/git/git/blob/7c2ef319c52c4997256f5807564523dfd4acdfc7/Documentation/technical/sparse-checkout.txt) ],
  the article details how other Git commands should properly recognize
  sparse-checkout, and suggests implementing the `--scope` option, which
  I think will solve the problem I encountered above, so I hope to implement it.

  This patch was put on hold by me for a while, as no one seemed to review it.

* If you could get a team of expert developers to work full time on
  something in Git for a full year, what would it be?

  I'd like to have a well-developed concurrency model on the Git server side.
  See ["Question: How to execute git-gc correctly on the git server"](https://lore.kernel.org/git/CAOLTT8Tt3jW2yvm6BRU3yG+EvW1WG9wWFq6PuOcaHNNLQAaGjg@mail.gmail.com/)
  for more details.

* If you could remove something from Git without worrying about
  backwards compatibility, what would it be?

  `git checkout`. It can be used to switch branches or restore working tree files,
  I think these two functions are somewhat coupled. I don't know if `git switch` and
  `git restore` would be perfect replacements for it.

* What is your favorite Git-related tool/library, outside of
  Git itself?

  [scalar](https://git-scm.com/docs/scalar). Now I really like to use scalar to
  download Git repositories to save time.

* Do you happen to have any memorable experience w.r.t. contributing to
  the Git project? If yes, could you share it with us?

  Mainly during GSOC, my mentor Christian Couder and many people in the Git
  community helped me, and I learned how to participate in open source for the
  first time. It was a great experience to be brave and discuss technology with
  people from all over the world.

* What is your toolbox for interacting with the mailing list and for
  development of Git?

  GitGitGadget. It has a clean commit process, and it runs GitHub action to
  help me find out if my patch is buggy before committing to the community.

* What is your advice for people who want to start Git development?
  Where and how should they start?

  1. First become its user
  2. Understand its principles through the documentation
  3. Read the source code to understand the general structure of the project
  4. Understand some sub-modules of the project by solving some problems
  5. Learn from others with an open mind

* If there's one tip you would like to share with other Git
  developers, what would it be?

  Stay curious about technology.
