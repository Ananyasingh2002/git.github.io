* [A Git history visualization page](https://git-history.jpalmer.dev/)
by Jeff Palmer &lt;<jeffrey.palmer@acm.org>&gt; shows "An Interactive Development History" of Git in
three columns: project and contributor statistics, relative cumulative 
contributions by contributor, and aggregated commits by 
contributor by month with milestone annotations. Jeff wrote 
[an associated blog post](https://jpalmer.dev/2021/05/interactive-git-history/) about how
he created the visualization, and he's also looking for
feedback and ideas for milestones or features he could add.
