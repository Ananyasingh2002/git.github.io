__Git tools and sites__

+ There are a few tools that use GPT-3 / ChatGPT Large Language Model (LLM) to
  help write commit messages. Please read the proposed commit message before
  accepting it, especially for more complex changes. Those tools, as far as I
  understand it, do not take information from an issue tracker, or from
  code review comments attached to a pull request (or contained in a specialized
  tool such as Gerrit) - so they cannot add this information to the proposed
  commit message, they can only halucinate it.
    + [OpenCommit](https://github.com/di-sukharev/opencommit)
      is GPT CLI to auto-generate impressive commits in 1 second;
      needs API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
      Uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org),
      can use [GitMoji](https://gitmoji.dev/).
      Written as Node\.js CLI app.
        + See also [OpenCommit: GPT generates impressive commits in 1 second (open-source)](https://dev.to/disukharev/opencommit-gpt-cli-to-auto-generate-impressive-commits-in-1-second-46dh)
          by Dima Sukharev on DEV\.to.
    + [AI Commits](https://github.com/Nutlope/aicommits)
      is a CLI app that writes your git commit messages for you with AI,
      that can also be used as [`prepare-commit-msg` hook](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_prepare_commit_msg).
      Requires [API key from OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
      Written as Node\.js v14+ CLI app.
        + See also [AI generated git commit messages](https://dev.to/bdougieyo/ai-generated-git-commit-messages-4j7g)
          by Brian Douglas on DEV\.to.
    + [AI-Commit](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/ai-commit)
      is a command line tool that uses [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)'s
      language generation capabilities to generate
      [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)
      messages for your Git repositories.  Written in Go.
    + [gptcommit](https://github.com/zurawiki/gptcommit) is
      a git prepare-commit-msg [hook](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks)
      for authoring commit messages with the [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)'s GPT-3 language model.
      Written in Rust.
        + Mentioned in [Git Rev News Edition #95](https://git.github.io/rev_news/2023/01/31/edition-95/);
          see also [an article](https://zura.wiki/post/never-write-a-commit-message-again-with-the-help-of-gpt-3/)
          about this tool there.

+ [Planar](https://www.useplanar.com/) is a Chrome extension
  that adds features used internally by big tech to GitHub code review.
    + See also [Planar - Add 10x features to GitHub code review](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/ICU-planar-add-10x-features-to-github-code-review)
      by Eshan Agarwal on Y Combinator (Launch YC).
+ [Git for Computer Scientists](https://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/)
  by Tommi Virtanen is a quick introduction to git internals for people
  who are not scared by words like Directed Acyclic Graph.
+ [Think Like (a) Git: a guide for the perplexed](https://think-like-a-git.net/)
  by Sam Livingston-Gray, intended for "advanced beginners" with Git
  to help them achieve some level of _Git enlightenment_.
