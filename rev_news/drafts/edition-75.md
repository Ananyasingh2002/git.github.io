## Developer Spotlight: Patrick Steinhardt

* Who are you and what do you do?

  I'm a software developer working at GitLab, more specifically in the
  team working on Gitaly. Gitaly is our RPC interface to all Git
  repositories, so it is the backbone to all things Git at GitLab.

  In my own free time, I love to tinker with my Gentoo-based systems and
  tailor them to my own needs, which results in occasional drive-by
  patches to all kinds of open source projects to scratch my own itches.

* What would you name your most important contribution to Git?

  To me, this is the introduction of the reference-transaction hook, which
  gets executed whenever a reference is about to be updated. This allows
  tight control over all reference updates happening in a given repository
  in a command-agnostic way. At GitLab, we use this hook to coordinate
  reference updates across multiple replicas of the same repository such
  that we can be sure that all nodes have the same state and move to the
  same state.

  My most important contributions I'd not locate in the Git project itself
  though, but instead in libgit2. While I unfortunately haven't found the
  time to contribute to it lately, I've done a lot more work on libgit2
  than I did on Git. And there it's probably the initial introduction of
  support for worktrees, maintenance of the CMake build system and work on
  the gitconfig subsystem.

* What are you doing on the Git project these days, and why?

  My current work is mostly focussed on tuning performance of some areas
  we have found to be slow for gitlab.com. This has motivated the recent
  introduction of a new `git-rev-list(1)` filter which allows to filter by
  object type via `--filter=object:type=<type>`. This makes it easy to
  find for example all blobs introduced between two revisions.

  And right now I'm trying to devise a new implementation of the object
  connectivity check performed by `git-receive-pack(1)` whenever a push gets
  accepted on the server side. Depending on the repository's shape, the
  current implementation can be a major bottleneck and take dozens of
  seconds to compute even for small pushes. You may have noticed this
  check when it says "Checking connectivity" on a push.

* If you could get a team of expert developers to work full time on
  something in Git for a full year, what would it be?

  I'm obviously biased coming from the libgit2 project, but I'd really
  love to further push the libification of Git. There has been great
  progress on this front already to make internal C interfaces look more
  like the typical interfaces you'd see from a linkable library. But my
  dream would be to merge the efforts of Git and libgit2 such that Git
  also provides an official library which can be linked against in your
  own program.

* If you could remove something from Git without worrying about
  backwards compatibility, what would it be?

  Tough question. There's many user-facing commands which could benefit
  from a more consistent design, but my take is that these probably could
  provide an improved user interface while still retaining backwards
  compatibility.

  But what I'd really love to get rid of is the file-based reference
  backend. It works reasonably well to represent references as file paths
  in smallish repositories, but even there it imposes limitations which
  are only a result of its implementation. It's also inefficient for
  bigger repositories and does not really allow for atomic modification of
  multiple references at once. There luckily is ongoing work on the
  reftable backend, which fixes many of the shortcomings, but it will
  likely still take some time to land.

* What is your favorite Git-related tool/library, outside of Git itself?

  I guess the answer to that question is going to be obvious by now:
  libgit2.
