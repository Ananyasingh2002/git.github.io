__Git tools and sites__
* [diffsitter](https://github.com/afnanenayet/diffsitter) creates semantically meaningful
  diffs that ignore formatting differences like spacing.  It does so by computing a diff
  on the AST (abstract syntax tree) of a file rather than computing the diff on the text
  contents of the file.  `diffsitter` uses the parsers from
  the [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter) project
  to parse source code.  Written in Rust, it is very much a work in progress.
