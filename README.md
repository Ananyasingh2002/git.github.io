## Git Developer Pages

- This is a website for information on Git development. If you stumbled into this by mistake, you may want:
  - Information on running Git and links to download the latest version from [HERE](https://git-scm.com/)
  - Wiki that has historically contained developer information from [HERE](https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page)

- These pages are intended to collect information useful to Git developers. This is also the web home of:
  - [Git Rev News newsletter](https://git.github.io/rev_news/)
  - the [involvement of the Git project in mentoring programs](https://git.github.io/General-Application-Information/) like [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) and the [GSoC (Google Summer of Code)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)
  
- These pages are intended to be edited collaboratively (i.e., it is an alternative to us having a wiki, but one that is edited entirely via Git pushes).
