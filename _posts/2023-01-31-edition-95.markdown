* [Question: How to execute git-gc correctly on the git server](https://lore.kernel.org/git/CAOLTT8Tt3jW2yvm6BRU3yG+EvW1WG9wWFq6PuOcaHNNLQAaGjg@mail.gmail.com/)

  ZheNing Hu asked about how he could run `git gc` correctly on his
  own Git server. He seemed to be afraid by
  [the `git gc` documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gc)
  saying that there is a risk of failures and repository corruption
  when the command is run concurrently with other Git processes.

  He said that he
  [read about `git gc --cruft`](https://github.blog/2022-09-13-scaling-gits-garbage-collection/)
  which could overcome these issues, but that he was still using Git
  v2.35 on his server while `--cruft` was introduced in v2.38.

  He also wondered if before v2.38 a repository level lock blocking
  some Git operations was needed and what any Git command run when the
  lock is taken should do and report.

  Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason replied that running `git gc` on a "live"
  repo was always racy, but the odds of corrupting the repo were
  becoming very small when the value of the `gc.pruneExpire` config
  option was increased. He said that the default setting for this
  option, 2 weeks, was "more than enough for even the most paranoid
  user".

  About `--cruft`, Ævar thought that its purpose was not only to avoid
  possible repo corruption, but also to allow more aggressive gc
  (garbage collection).

  He also wondered if this question was about large hosting sites like
  GitHub, and GitLab where `git gc` is run on live repos, and
  suggested not to worry in this case, but to take backups.

  Jeff King, alias Peff, replied to Ævar saying he was "a bit less
  optimistic" about the corruption risk decreasing when
  `gc.pruneExpire` is increased because there was no atomic view of
  the ref namespace. So renaming a branch for example was risky
  because it could be seen as removing a branch and adding a different
  one by any concurrent process. Such a process could be another push,
  not just a gc.

  Peff also said that using `--cruft` was not so much about avoiding
  corruption, but about keeping cruft objects out of the main pack to
  reduce the cost of lookups and bitmaps, and about avoiding to
  explode a lot of old objects into loose objects, which could be very
  bad for performance.

  Ævar replied to Peff discussing further when corruption was likely
  or not to happen, which issues `--cruft` could help with, and a
  patch he sent in the past to reduce possible corruption. He also
  suggested running `git gc` on the least busy hours of the day.

  Later Taylor Blau replied to Ævar and Peff discussing `--cruft` in
  the context of single-pack bitmaps or multi-pack (MIDX) bitmaps, and
  in the context of GitHub.

  In the meantime, Michal Suchánek replied to Ævar's first email
  asking what the 2 week default expiration time applied to. He also
  said that he got corrupted repos with less than 100 users "and some
  scripting" which went away when gc was disabled.

  Peff replied to Michal, saying that the expiration time applied to
  the `mtime` on the object file (or the pack containing it), and
  confirmed that it was "far from a complete race-free solution".

  ZheNing also replied to Michal saying that he prefered "no error at
  all" rather than a "small probability of error".

  Michal replied to Peff listing some workflows that are more likely
  to lead to a corrupt repo, like deleting branches but pushing other
  branches that are variant of these branches, and different people
  pushing files from the same external source.

  Peff confirmed that these workflows were indeed risky, and detailed
  a bit further how the race conditions can happen.

  ZheNing then replied to Peff asking if there was a way like a lock
  on the repository to avoid for example concurrent push and gc
  processes.

  Ævar replied that there was no such way but that we should have
  one. He explained that it could perhaps be done using hooks,
  [like 'pre-receive' and 'post-receive'](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks),
  when we are sure that all relevant operations are going through
  these hooks. (For example no local branch deletion should be
  possible.)

  ZheNing and Michal, discussed a bit further the details related to
  how a repo corruption can happen with concurrent push and gc
  processes, and how that could possibly be avoided.

## Developer Spotlight: Teng Long

* Who are you and what do you do?

  My work is related to R&D efficiency tools development at Alibaba Cloud.
  Our team have currently built a code hosting service as codeup.aliyun.com
  which provides free and high-quality code services for Chinese developers
  on the public cloud. In addition, I used to be a Gerrit contributor, because
  I wrote Java for nearly 10 years, and this process made me almost forget
  the C language, LOL.

  For the contributions of Git community, apart from me, Jiang Xin (the Git
  localization coordinator), ZheNing Hu, Chen BoJun are also in my team.

* What would you name your most important contribution to Git?

  First of all, I know Git for some years, but I'm new in the community,
  because Git's technical depth is obvious which involves algorithms,
  operating systems, testing techniques, etc. Also, Git have many
  subcommands, which makes the implementation of Git itself involve
  many aspects, I think it is difficult for a new contributor to understand
  everything, but long-term participation may make you an expert in one
  aspect of Git. Sadly, my time devoted to the Git community is actually
  limited.

  I contributed a feature last year to allow the `git ls-tree` subcommand
  to support the `--format` option which let you print out the result as you
  want, this is helpful for some automated tools or scripted work I think. If
  you want to know about it further, a better way is to read [the blog by
  Taylor Blau](https://github.blog/2022-04-18-highlights-from-git-2-36/#tidbits).

* What are you doing on the Git project these days, and why?

  I've been following the evolution of the `bundle-uri` feature recently, I think
  the idea of this feature is great and attractive. If used properly, it can not
  only improve the speed of code download in some scenarios, but also
  reduce the load on the server.

  I'm also reading about algorithms related code (like bitmap, multi-pack bitmap,
  bloom-filter), I want to know some details about the combination of Git and
  algorithm. I think it's interesting.

* If you could get a team of expert developers to work full time on
  something in Git for a full year, what would it be?

  We all know that it can be a pain in terms of resource load and cost to
  provide large-scale Git services. I hope to be able to solve the problem
  with Git's storage and computing coupling to let Git be better
  to integrate with cloud-native architecture. Like, should it be possible
  to store the refs, loose objects and packs on a Distributed Database？

  I think this is one of the future development direction of the Git
  architecture, starting from lower cost and cloud friendliness. If you want to
  do these tasks based on Git, you may need to make the internal related
  implementations more adaptable, which requires a lot of professional work
  I think.

* If you could remove something from Git without worrying about
  backwards compatibility, what would it be?

  Actually I don't know, for reviewers, they are weighing the impact of
  compatibility, although some patches are doing the right thing, which may
  be contradictory, but there is no way to solve it perfectly, because Git
  is one of the most widely used tools for developers in the world now.

* What is your favorite Git-related tool/library, outside of
  Git itself?

  I prefer [git-repo](https://github.com/alibaba/git-repo-go) which supports
  doing code reviews or pull requests on the client, just like using a native
  Git subcommand.

* Do you happen to have any memorable experience w.r.t contributing to
  the Git project? If yes, could you share it with us?

  Still memorable when my first commit was merged in, even though it was
  a small fix. This process made me understand that contributing to Git is
  completely different from other workflows, and the process and results both
  feel good.

* What is your toolbox for interacting with the mailing list and for
  development of Git?

  First, I use "https://public-inbox.org/git/?q=a%3Adyroneteng" to check if
  there is any new mails related to me.

  Then, I've been using `git format-patch` to create patchsets and `git send-email`
  to post them, and `git am` for local reviews. I don't know if there's a better
  way, but it seems to be enough for me.

* What is your advice for people who want to start Git development?
  Where and how should they start?

  Contributing to Git is not an easy task, after all, you are working with
  other excellent contributors in the community, but continuous understanding
  and participation may make you an expert in a certain direction.

* If there's one tip you would like to share with other Git
  developers, what would it be?

  I think it would be "get used to the process of contribution slowly".

  The review process is sometimes frustrating, but most of the suggestions by
  reviewers are still valuable, we can learn a lot from the process, then you
  can better participate in the next contribution.
